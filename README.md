# Paylocity-code-challenge
Contains the completed code challenge for my upcoming interview with Paylocity

## Compilation/running
To compile/run, first open a terminal and navigate to the relavant directory
  javac deductionCalc.java 
  java deductionCalc

## Running the program
The program will ask you to enter the name of the primary, and then asks for the name of the dependants.

The program will then do some simple calculations to determine what deduction is made monthly for benefits
  and also tells you what your paycheck will be after deductions.
  
## known issues
  Due to time constraints, I had trouble allowing for whitespace between names of the primary's
    dependants.
